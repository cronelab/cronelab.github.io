          Under the direction of Dr. Nathan Crone, the JHU Cognitive
          Neurophysiology and BMI Lab is working to identify and validate
          electrophysiological signatures of human cortical processing and to
          use them to study the neural mechanisms of motor, sensory, and
          language functions. Where applicable, we are applying this
          understanding to the development of assistive systems for individuals
          with disabilities.

            Large-scale dynamics in the paradox of behavioral priming
          </h2>
          <p>
            Behavioral responses to a perceptual stimulus are typically faster
            with repeated exposure to the stimulus (behavioral priming). This
            implicit learning mechanism is critical for survival but impaired in
            a variety of neurological disorders, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
            Many studies of the neural bases for behavioral priming have
            encountered an interesting paradox: in spite of faster behavioral
            responses, repeated stimuli usually elicit weaker neural responses
            (repetition suppression). Several neurophysiological models have
            been proposed to resolve this paradox, but noninvasive techniques
            for human studies have had insufficient spatial-temporal precision
            for testing their predictions. We used the unparalleled precision of
            electrocorticography (ECoG) to analyze the timing and magnitude of
            task-related changes in neural activation and propagation while
            patients named novel vs repeated visual objects. Stimulus repetition
            was associated with faster verbal responses and decreased neural
            activation (repetition suppression) in ventral occipito-temporal
            cortex (VOTC) and left prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Interestingly, we
            also observed increased neural activation (repetition enhancement)
            in LPFC and other recording sites.

            Moreover, with analysis of high gamma propagation we observed
            increased top-down propagation from LPFC into VOTC, preceding
            repetition suppression. The latter results indicate that repetition
            suppression and behavioral priming are associated with strengthening
            of top-down network influences on perceptual processing, consistent
            with predictive coding models of repetition suppression, and they
            support a central role for changes in large-scale cortical dynamics
            in achieving more efficient and rapid behavioral responses.

            Semi-Autonomous iEEG Brain-Machine Interfaces

          <p>
            We developed a novel system, the Hybrid Augmented Reality Multimodal
            Operation Neural Integration Environment (HARMONIE). This system
            utilizes hybrid input, supervisory control, and intelligent robotics
            to allow users to identify an object (via eye tracking and computer
            vision) and initiate (via brain-control) a semi-autonomous
            reach-grasp-and-drop of the object by the JHU/APL Modular Prosthetic
            Limb MPL. The novel approach demonstrated in this proof-of-principle
            study, using hybrid input, supervisory control, and intelligent
            robotics, addresses limitations of current BMIs.{' '}

          <h2 className="featurette-heading">Redefining Broca's Area</h2>
          <p>
            During the cued production of words, a temporal cascade of neural
            activity proceeds from sensory representations of words in the
            temporal cortex to their corresponding articulatory gestures in the
            motor cortex. Broca's area mediates this cascade through reciprocal
            interactions with temporal and frontal motor regions. Contrary to
            classNameic notions of the role of Broca's area in speech, while the
            motor cortex is activated during spoken responses, Broca's area is
            surprisingly silent. Moreover, when novel strings of articulatory
            gestures must be produced in response to nonword stimuli, neural
            activity is enhanced in Broca's area, but not in the motor cortex.
            These unique data provide evidence that Broca's area coordinates the
            transformation of information across large-scale cortical networks
            involved in spoken word production. In this role, Broca's area
            formulates an appropriate articulatory code to be implemented by the
            motor cortex.

            Seizure Connectivity Patterns Occur Interictally
          </h2>
          <p>
            The directionality and intensity of high frequency activity (70-175
            Hz) propagation was estimated during ictal and interictal
            recordings. These analyses revealed prominent divergence and
            convergence of activity propagation at sites identified by
            epileptologists as part of the ictal onset zone. In patients with
            focal ictal onsets, the patterns of propagation recorded during
            pre-ictal and interictal intervals were very similar to those
            recorded during seizures. The ability to characterize epileptogenic
            networks interictally could have important clinical implications by
            reducing the need for prolonged invasive monitoring to record
            spontaneous seizures.

            Significance of event related causality (ERC) in eloquent neural
            networks
          </h2>
          <p>
            During most cognitive tasks neural activity is propagated across
            large-scale cortical networks on very brief time scales. Studying
            such transient and complex systems calls for a short time-window on
            the one hand, and a great extent of recording sites in the brain, on
            the other. These demands are not easily satisfied, as short time
            intervals do not provide enough data-points to model the dynamics of
            large-scale brain networks. This limitation can be overcome by using
            multiple realizations of the same process, e.g. multiple trials of a
            task (Ding et al., 2000), but the price to be paid is that
            traditional statistical methods, cannot be used to assess the
            significance of event-related changes in the estimated dynamics of
            the system. We propose event-related causality (ERC) with
            two-dimensional (2D) moving average, a new method for assessing
            statistical confidence in such cases. This approach can be applied
            when very few realizations, or trials, of a studied process are
            available, including when only single trials are available. ERC with
            2D moving average ensures precise embedding of statistical
            significance in two-dimensional space, and can analyze much longer
            time series. We also propose a criterion for statistical model
            selection, based on both goodness of fit and width of confidence
            intervals. Using ERC with 2D moving average to study naming under
            conditions in which perceptual modality and ambiguity were
            contrasted, we observed new patterns of task-related neural
            propagation that were nevertheless consistent with expectations
            derived from previous studies of naming. ERC with 2D moving average
            is uniquely suitable to both research and clinical applications and
            can be used to estimate the statistical significance of neural
            propagation for both cognitive neuroscientific studies and
            functional brain mapping prior to resective surgery for epilepsy and
            brain tumors.

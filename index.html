				  <h2>Semi-Autonomous iEEG Brain-Machine Interfaces</h2>
				  <p>Abstract: To increase the ability of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to control advanced prostheses such as the modular prosthetic limb (MPL), we are developing a novel system: the Hybrid Augmented Reality Multimodal Operation Neural Integration Environment (HARMONIE). This system utilizes hybrid input, supervisory control, and intelligent robotics to allow users to identify an object (via eye tracking and computer vision) and initiate (via brain-control) a semi-autonomous reach-grasp-and-drop of the object by the MPL. Sequential iterations of HARMONIE were tested in two pilot subjects implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) and depth electrodes within motor areas. The subjects performed the complex task in 71.4% (20/28) and 67.7% (21/31) of trials after minimal training. Balanced accuracy for detecting movements was 91.1% and 92.9%, significantly greater than chance accuracies (p < 0.05). After BMI-based initiation, the MPL completed the entire task 100% (one object) and 70% (three objects) of the time. The MPL took approximately 12.2 seconds for task completion after system improvements implemented for the second subject. Our hybrid-BMI design prevented all but one baseline false positive from initiating the system. The novel approach demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study, using hybrid input, supervisory control, and intelligent robotics, addresses limitations of current BMIs. </p>

				  <h2>iEEG Control of Reach and Grasp</h2>
				  <p>Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals from two human subjects were used to achieve simultaneous neural control of reaching and grasping movements with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL) Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL), a dexterous robotic prosthetic arm. We performed functional mapping of high gamma activity while the subject made reaching and grasping movements to identify task-selective electrodes. Independent, online control of reaching and grasping was then achieved using high gamma activity from a small subset of electrodes with a model trained on short blocks of reaching and grasping with no further adaptation. Classification accuracy did not decline (p <; 0.05, one-way ANOVA) over three blocks of testing in either subject. Mean classification accuracy during independently executed overt reach and grasp movements for (Subject 1, Subject 2) were (0.85, 0.81) and (0.80, 0.96), respectively, and during simultaneous execution they were (0.83, 0.88) and (0.58, 0.88), respectively. Our models leveraged knowledge of the subject's individual functional neuroanatomy for reaching and grasping movements, allowing rapid acquisition of control in a time-sensitive clinical setting. We demonstrate the potential feasibility of verifying functionally meaningful iEEG-based control of the MPL prior to chronic implantation, during which additional capabilities of the MPL might be exploited with further training. </p>

				  <h2>ECoG Functional Mapping of Auditory and Visual Cortex</h2>
				  <p>Abstract:More comprehensive, and efficient, mapping strategies are needed to avoid post-operative language impairments in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. Conservative resection of dominant anterior frontal or temporal cortex frequently results in post-operative naming deficits despite standard pre-operative electrocortical stimulation mapping of visual object (picture) naming. Naming to auditory description may better simulate word retrieval in human conversation but is not typically tested, in part due to the time demands of electrocortical stimulation mapping. Electrocorticographic high gamma (60-150 Hz) activity, recorded simultaneously through the same electrodes used for stimulation mapping, has recently been used to map brain function more efficiently, and has at times predicted deficits not anticipated based on stimulation mapping alone. The present study investigated electrocorticographic mapping of visual object naming and auditory descriptive naming within conservative dominant temporal or frontal lobe resection boundaries in 16 patients with 933 subdural electrodes implanted for epilepsy surgery planning. A logistic regression model showed that electrodes within traditional conservative dominant frontal or temporal lobe resection boundaries were significantly more likely to record high gamma activity during auditory descriptive naming than during visual object naming. Eleven patients ultimately underwent resection and 7 demonstrated post-operative language deficits not anticipated based on electrocortical stimulation mapping alone. Four patients with post-operative deficits underwent a resection that included sites where high gamma activity was observed during naming. These findings indicate that electrocorticographic mapping of auditory descriptive naming may reduce the risk of permanent post-operative language deficits following dominant temporal or frontal resection.</p>
